============

#### Successful use of Git, GitHub, and build automation tools (5/5)

#### Basic proficiency in Java (17/20)
* You should use the most general static type in variable declarations (e.g. `Map` instead of `Hashtable`). ([link](https://github.com/CMU-15-214/zhilinh/blob/master/homework/1/src/main/java/edu/cmu/cs/cs214/hw1/Document.java#L15))
* You should have simply indexed into the `docList2`, which is O(1), instead of removing the first element, which is O(n). ([link](https://github.com/CMU-15-214/zhilinh/blob/master/homework/1/src/main/java/edu/cmu/cs/cs214/hw1/ClosestMatch.java#L27))
* -0.1, You should use a `HashMap` instead of a `Hashtable` if you need a `Map` object. ([link](https://github.com/CMU-15-214/zhilinh/blob/master/homework/1/src/main/java/edu/cmu/cs/cs214/hw1/Document.java#L68))

#### Fulfilling the technical requirements of the program specification (15/15)

#### Documentation and code style (8/10)
* Missing comments describing complex sections of code. ([link](https://github.com/CMU-15-214/zhilinh/blob/master/homework/1/src/main/java/edu/cmu/cs/cs214/hw1/ClosestMatches.java#L43))
